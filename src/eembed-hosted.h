 The integer constant 1 if the implementation is a hosted

 C99 standard (section 6.10.8):

 "The standard also defines two environments for programs, a
 freestanding environment, required of all implementations and which
 may not have library facilities beyond those required of
 freestanding implementations, where the handling of program startup
 and termination are implementation-defined; and a hosted
 environment, which is not required, in which all the library
 facilities are provided and startup is through a function int main
 (void) or int main (int, char *[]). An OS kernel is an example of a
 program running in a freestanding environment; a program using the
 facilities of an operating system is an example of a program
 running in a hosted environment."
